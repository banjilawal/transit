# Common Package

## Purpose
Provides foundational utilities, enums, exceptions, and common classes used throughout the 
application. This package serves as a shared library of core components that support other 
packages.

## Key Components

### Utilities
Common utility classes that provide reusable functionality across the application.

### Enums
Global enumeration types that define common constants and types.

### Exceptions
Standard exception hierarchy for error handling and system-wide exception management.

### Common Classes
Shared base classes and commonly used implementations.

## Build System
Contains factory classes responsible for system construction. These factories must be 
executed in a specific sequence to ensure proper system initialization.

### Factory Sequence
1. Core initialization factories
2. Component builders
3. System configuration factories

## Usage Guidelines

### Utility Classes
- Keep stateless when possible
- Follow utility class pattern with private constructor
- Use static methods

### Exception Handling
- Use provided exception types
- Follow the exception hierarchy
- Include appropriate error context

### Common Classes Usage
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow the established patterns
- Document any deviations

## Technical Notes
- All utility classes are thread-safe
- Enums are immutable by design
- Factory classes follow the builder pattern
- Exception handling supports chaining

## Dependencies
This package is a base package and should have minimal external dependencies to prevent 
circular dependencies.

## Package Maintenance
When adding new components:
- Ensure global applicability
- Follow established naming conventions
- Add appropriate documentation
- Update factory sequence if required
