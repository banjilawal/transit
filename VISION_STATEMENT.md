## TransitCraft: Frequent, Fast, Cheap, Everywhere: Pick Two
TransitCraft is a game where you try and design a mass transit that is:
- **Frequent:** You don't have to wait long for a bus or train.
- **Fast:** You get to your destination almost as fast as a car!
- **Cheap:** It's crazy affordable! Almost too cheap to meter!
- **Everywhere:** A five year old child is five minutes away from a bus stop!

Can you get two? Can you get three? Mass Transit engineers have been stumped by these problems ever since 
Hammurabi.
