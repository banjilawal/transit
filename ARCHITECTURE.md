# System Architecture
---
## Purpose and Scope
- High level overview of the system architecture's layers
- Future directions
- Installation

---
### Common Classes
Foundational classes that:
- Define shared base functionality
- Establish standard patterns
- Provide reusable implementations

---
## Build System Vision
- Jar file builds entire system.
- Installation and verification success is logged.

---
### Factory-Based Construction
The system employs a factory-based build approach where:
- Factories handle component creation
- Construction follows a defined sequence
- Dependencies are managed systematically

---
### Sequential Build Process
Build sequence ensures:
- Proper initialization order
- Dependency satisfaction
- System integrity

---
## Future Directions
### Planned Enhancements
- Improve search search features
- Add modules for dynamic route optimization
- Create modules for experimenting with concurrency.
- Separate reporting and diagnosis from build
- Enhanced build system capabilities
- Add intuitive UI

---
### Growth Areas
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Potential new common functions
- Build system improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Reporting and logging
- Saving state
- Installation 
- Uninstallation

---
## Success Metrics

### Quality Indicators
- Passes unit and integration tests
- High unit test coverage
- Build system reliability
- No orphaned stations
- does not generate islands (disconnected graphs)

### Usage Goals
- High component reuse
- Minimal package dependencies
- Clear usage patterns
- Packaged installer
