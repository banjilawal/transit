# TransitCraft

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Java game The application gives the fastest bus route from a starting address
to a destination. Mass transit systems are multilayered graphs where the weights 
for two routing requests with the same sources and destinations can have different 
shortest path recommendations because the network conditions are dynamic. 
I discovered different graph algorithms are required to provide a solution.
